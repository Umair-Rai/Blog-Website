**Blog Website**

A responsive blogging platform built with Angular, featuring dynamic content and a modern UI.

**Overview**
This project is a fully functional blogging website developed using Angular. It demonstrates my skills in frontend development, including component-based architecture, routing, and API integration. The site allows users to browse blog posts, view individual articles, and enjoy a seamless, responsive experience.

**Features**
Dynamic Routing: Navigate between home, blog list, and individual post pages using Angular Router.
Component-Based Design: Modular components for reusable UI elements (e.g., header, footer, post cards).
Responsive Layout: Styled with CSS to adapt to various screen sizes.
API Integration: Fetches blog data via RESTful API calls (mock or real backend).
User-Friendly UI: Clean design with intuitive navigation.
Technologies Used
Angular: Framework for building the frontend.
TypeScript: For type-safe coding and Angular compatibility.
HTML/CSS: For structure and styling.
Git: Version control and collaboration.
